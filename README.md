1. Project Overview
We built an end-to-end data engineering solution using Azure cloud tools. Our aim was to design a robust pipeline that could ingest, transform, and serve data efficiently for analytics and reporting, closely simulating a real-world data engineering scenario.

2. Step-by-Step: What We Did
Step 1: Set Up the Azure Environment
We created a free Azure account.

Accessed the Azure portal to manage all our cloud resources.

Step 2: Chose and Ingested the Dataset
We selected the AdventureWorks dataset.

Why AdventureWorks? Itâ€™s a comprehensive, multi-table dataset commonly used in the industry, perfect for demonstrating joins, lookups, and complex data relationships.

Instead of uploading files manually, we pulled the data directly from an API (simulating a GitHub source), making our pipeline dynamic and closer to real-world practices.

Step 3: Designed the Data Architecture (Medallion Architecture)
Bronze Layer: We stored the raw data as it was ingested, with no changes.

Silver Layer: We cleaned and transformed the data using Azure Databricks (Spark).

Gold Layer: We loaded the final, refined data into Azure Synapse Analytics, making it ready for analysis and reporting.

Step 4: Built the Data Pipeline
Used Azure Data Factory to orchestrate the entire workflow.

Set up dynamic pipelines with parameters and loops for flexibility.

Automated data movement and transformation between layers.

Performed data cleaning, joining, and aggregation in Databricks.

Step 5: Enabled Analytics and Reporting
Loaded the processed data into Azure Synapse Analytics (our data warehouse).

Connected Synapse to Power BI for visualization and reporting, completing the end-to-end flow.

3. Why We Chose This Approach
AdventureWorks dataset: Itâ€™s industry-standard, rich with multiple related tables, and ideal for demonstrating complex data engineering tasks.

API ingestion: Simulates real-time data pipelines, not just static file uploads.

Medallion architecture: Follows best practices for scalable, maintainable data engineering.

Azure tools: These are in-demand in the job market and offer seamless integration for cloud-based data solutions.
